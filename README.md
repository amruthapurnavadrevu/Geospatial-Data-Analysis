# Geospatial-Data-Analysis

This project presents a geospatial analysis of Edinburgh's bus network, focusing on average bus speeds and the distribution of bus stops across various datazones.

### Tools Used 

* QGIS for spatial data analysis and visualization
* PostgreSQL for database management and queries

### Visualization

### Findings

The poster's findings align with real-world observations: areas with a higher density of bus stops tend to experience slower speeds. This is likely due to increased dwell times at stops and potential traffic congestion.

For instance, Princes Street, a highly congested area during peak hours, has the highest bus stop density according to the poster. However, the surrounding areas appear to have a lower density of stops. Strategically placing more bus stops in these peripheral areas could help divert traffic away from Princes Street, alleviating congestion.

In conclusion, this geospatial analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing Edinburgh's bus network. By strategically distributing bus stops and potentially rerouting buses, the city can improve accessibility and overall network efficiency.
